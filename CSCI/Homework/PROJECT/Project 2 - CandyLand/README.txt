ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project implements an interactive board game fashioned after the game
Candyland. The user plays the role of a player in a quest through the vast
Candyland world to collect and use candies as they travel to the castle. As the
player acquires more Candy, they also have to defeat the other Players,
randomly throughout the land should a Calamity arise! The goal of the game is to find and collect candies, while racing the other player to the end of the board to reach the Castle.
